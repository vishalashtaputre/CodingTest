Problem1 - 
Implemented the print() method such that it creates the integer array and initializes it from 1 to 100. 
It then iterates through array and checks if the number is multiple of 3, if yes then prints letter "F". 
Else if it checks if the number is multiple of 5, if yes then prints letter "B".
Else if it checks if the number is multiple of 15, if yes then prints letters "FB".
Else prints the number itself.

Problem2 - 
Implemented the reverseString method such that it uses recursion logic.

Problem3 -
Implemented the collectionFun method which first generates the unique random numbers (of type double).
It then adds the generated random numbers to HashMap and later creates a Set out of it.
It then gets a List out of a set by adding the Set to List.
It then sorts the List in natural order and later prints the List with Row number and the random number associated with it.

Problem4 - 
Implemented the equals and hashcode methods for Person class.
And later implemented the doTheyMatch() method which checks if the given two Person objects are equal or not by calling the equals method.
Additionally, it adds the Person objects to HashSet and later fetches the size of HashSet to check whether they are unique in itself.
If both the objects are equal and unique then it returns true () else it returns false.
